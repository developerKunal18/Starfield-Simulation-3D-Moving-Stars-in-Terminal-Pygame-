## 🚀 Features

### ⭐ Warp Tunnel  
Stars leave streak trails behind them, creating the iconic warp-speed tunnel effect.

### 🌈 Galaxy Color Mode  
Stars change color based on their speed & distance — from blue to white to yellow to red.

### 🛸 Spaceship Steering  
Use arrow keys to tilt/steer the camera, giving the illusion of flying through space.

### ⚡ Hyperspeed Boost  
Hold **SPACE** to accelerate star movement ×3.5, simulating hyperspace jumps.

### 🌠 Shooting Stars  
Rare, high-velocity streaks crossing the screen for added realism.

### 🌀 Spiral Mode  
Press **S** to enable galaxy rotation / wormhole-like spiraling motion.

### 🎧 Audio Sync Mode  
Stars pulse and speed up based on microphone input using FFT analysis.  
(Requires `numpy` + `sounddevice`)
